Views B Grid
------------------------

Provides ability to put Views content in responsive columns that matches the grid columns in Backdrop core.

INTRODUCTION
------------

Allow designers to use extra Bootstrap CSS classes, wrappers, and containers to help style Views content.  They are based on Bootstrap 4 and output markup/classes such as "container", "col-md-6" etc. 
The module can output the region types container-fluid (full width container), fixed-width container which can then be used for Bootstrap grids.

It is possible that you may need to write custom CSS in your theme to fully realize your vision, this module just helps out.
