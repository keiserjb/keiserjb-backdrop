Text Resize
======================
The Text Resize module creates a block with links that use
jQuery to resize text within the specified DIV.

Text Resize was by Mark W. Jarrell (attheshow) at
Fleet Thought (http://fleetthought.com).


Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.

Differences from Drupal 7
-------------------------

- Should work the same as Drupal 7.

Customization
-------

Text Resize should work fine with the Bartik, Garland or Zen-based themes.  If it's not working for your
installation, you may need to change the div that's being resized. Please use the administration form for
Text Resize to customize. More customization tips can be found in the help for the module.
