# Read More Extra Field

The Read More Extra Field module replaces the default "Read more" link
(displayed when nodes are rendered as teasers) by an extra field.

Why and when is this module helpful?

Fields appearance order is easily configurable via the display settings. It is
thus easy to move the Read more link before or after any other field of your
entities.

The Read More extra field is not intrusive. It can be enabled on any fieldable
entity of your choice, and you can decide to keep the default Read More link.
The default Read More link only appear in Teaser mode. It can be annoying when
you create custom view modes. The Read More Extra Field is available in all
view modes.

The Read More Extra Field module comes with some additional useful settings :
It is possible to configure the Read More link text, or add CSS classes.

This module can also be used to easily hide the default Read More link when
it is not needed.
