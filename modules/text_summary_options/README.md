Text Summary Options
======================

This module provides site builders with additional options for the 'summary'
field when using "Text Area with a Summary" widget.

Often, a summary or teaser field is used when displaying content in views.
Backdrop already has built-in support for a summary field, however there is not
much control of whether or not it is displayed, or required.
